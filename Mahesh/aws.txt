what is aws
AWS, or Amazon Web Services
AWS is a cloud computing platform, meaning it provides IT resources (like servers, storage, and databases) over the internet, rather than requiring businesses to own and manage their own physical infrastructure. 

How it works:
AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the resources you use, and you can scale your resources up or down as needed. 

AWS services:
Amazon EC2: Provides virtual servers in the cloud. 
Amazon S3: Provides object storage. 
Amazon Lambda: Enables serverless computing.

aws api gateway
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-web-service-introduction-to-api-gateway/

Amazon Web Service – Introduction to API Gateway
Firstly, API stands for Application Program Interface. An API Gateway is a management tool that acts as an interface between users and microservices. The Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service that allows users to create, publish, secure, maintain and monitor APIs at any scale. It is serverless. It supports HTTP, WebSocket, and REST APIs. API Gateway is a type of server that provides the service of API which is used to customize each client.

What is Amazon API Gateway?
API Gateway act as a server between client applications and backend services if clients make any API request they will all go through this particular API Gateway. API Gateway is responsible for routing the request from the client side to the appropriate services, as well as performing other tasks such as authentication, authorization, and traffic management.

How Amazon API Gateway Works?
An API Gateway endpoint receives requests from clients. The request will be routed to the relevant backend service via API Gateway to the proper service. After processing the request, the backend service provides a response then the client receives the response from API Gateway.

--------------------------------------------------
What types of APIs does Amazon API Gateway support?

REST APIs
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way

SOAP APIs
Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP) is a network protocol for exchanging structured data between nodes. It uses XML format to transfer messages.

GraphQL APIs
WebSocket APIs

--------------------------------------------------
Features of Amazon API Gateway

API creation and deployment: Creating different types of APIs and managing them will be very easy.

Authorization and access control: With the help of IAM roles, IAM policies, and custom authorizers you can achieve authorization and control mechanisms that API Gateway offers for your APIs.

--------------------------------------------------
Amazon API Gateway Architecture

Amazon API Gateway provides customers with an integrated and consistent developer experience for building AWS serverless applications. It acts as a gateway for applications to access data from your backend services such as code running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2),  AWS Lambda, any web applications, etc.

The entire architecture of AWS API Gateway consists of the below key components:
Amazon API Gateway: It is used to create, publish, secure, maintain and monitor APIs.

API Gateway Cache: Users can enable API caching to cache their endpoint responses, which can reduce the number of calls made to the endpoint and also improve the latency of API requests.

Amazon Cloud Watch: It is a monitoring and observability service. It collects monitoring and operational data and visualizes it using automated dashboards, which allows users to visually monitor calls to their services.

--------------------------------------------------
Working With Amazon API Gateway
The Amazon API Gateway can be accessed through the following:

AWS Management Console
AWS Command Line Interface

For example, if you want to create an HTTP API, first you can create a lambda function and for creating a AWS lambda function, you have to use the lambda service of AWS, then you have to create HTTP API using API Gateways followed by testing the API.

Note:
Choose the backend service you want to integrate with the API. For instance, API Gateway can invoke the Lambda function you’ve created earlier and return the function’s response to the client.

---------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------
rest api
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/

REST API Introduction
REST API stands for REpresentational State Transfer API. It is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) that allows communication between different systems over the internet. REST APIs work by sending requests and receiving responses, typically in JSON format, between the client and server.

REST APIs use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to define actions that can be performed on resources.

A request is sent from the client to the server via a web URL, using one of the HTTP methods. The server then responds with the requested resource, which could be HTML, XML, Image, or JSON, with JSON being the most commonly used format for modern web services.

---------------------------------------------------
aws serverless
https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs
The Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of "serverless architectures", a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar "serverless" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.

aws serverless.yml
https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml

---------------------------------------------------
aws serverless api gateway
https://www.serverless.com/guides/amazon-api-gateway

How does API Gateway work with the Serverless Framework?
The Serverless Framework uses a "Lambda Proxy integration" to make API Gateway events easily available to your Serverless functions. For example, for a simple HTTP API you would specify the API Gateway endpoint that you want attached to your Serverless function right in the serverless.yml file:

# serverless.yml
functions:
  index:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http: GET hello # this is the API Gateway event

In this example, the entire payload from the API request will be passed into the handler.hello handler and made available to your Serverless function.

Lambda Proxy Integration
Simple HTTP Endpoint
This setup specifies that the hello function should be run when someone accesses the API gateway at hello via a GET request.

aws iam
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/identity-and-access-management-iam-in-amazon-web-services-aws/

Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) manages Amazon Web Services (AWS) users and their access to AWS accounts and services. It controls the level of access a user can have over an AWS account & sets users, grant permission, and allows a user to use different features of an AWS account.

Identity and access management is mainly used to manage users, groups, roles, and Access policies. The account we created to sign in to Amazon web services is known as the "root account" and it holds all the administrative rights and has access to all parts of the account. The new user created on AWS account, by default they have no access to any services in the account & it is done with the help of IAM that the root account holder can implement access policies and grant permission to the user to access certain services. 

---------------------------------------------------
How IAM Works?
IAM verifies that a user or service has the necessary authorization to access a particular service in the AWS cloud. We can also use IAM to grant the right level of access to specific users, groups, or services. For example, we can use IAM to enable an EC2 instance to access S3 buckets by requesting fine-grained permissions.

---------------------------------------------------
What does IAM do?
With the help of IAM, we perform the following 

IAM Identities
IAM Identities assists us in controlling which users can access which services and resources in the AWS Console and also we can assign policies to the users, groups, and roles. The IAM Identities can be created by using the Root user 

IAM Identities Classified As
IAM Users
IAM Groups
IAM Roles

Root user 
The root user will automatically be created and granted unrestricted rights. 
We can also create an admin user with fewer powers to control the entire Amazon account.

IAM Users
We can utilize IAM users to access the AWS Console and their administrative permissions differ from those of the Root user 

IAM Groups
A group is a collection of users, and a single person can be a member of several groups. With the aid of groups, we can manage permissions for many users quickly and efficiently.

IAM Roles
"IAM roles are similar to IAM users" in that they may be assumed by anybody who requires them. By using roles, we can provide AWS Services access rights to other AWS Services.

IAM Policies 
IAM Policies can manage access for AWS by attaching them to the IAM Identities or resources. "IAM policies defines permissions of AWS identities" and AWS resources when a user or any resource makes a request to AWS, it will validate these policies and confirms whether the request to be allowed or to be denied. AWS policies are stored in the form of Json format the number of policies to be attached to particular IAM identities depends upon no.of permissions required for one IAM identity. IAM identity can have multiple policies attached to them.

aws ec2
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2/

AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Amazon Web Service EC2 is a web service which is provided by the AWS cloud which is secure, resizable, and scalable. These virtual machines are pre-configured with the operating systems and some of the required software. Instead of managing the infrastructure, AWS will do that so you can just launch and terminate the EC2 instance whenever you want.

It is a cloud computing service offered by the Cloud Service Provider AWS. You can deploy your applications in EC2 servers without any worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You configure the EC2-Instance in a very secure manner. You can scale the configuration of the EC2 instance you have configured based on the demand of the application.

---------------------------------------------------
aws cloudwatch
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-amazon-cloudwatch/

Introduction to Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch is a service used for monitoring and observing resources in real-time, built for DevOps engineers, developers, testers. CloudWatch provides users with data and action to monitor their respective applications. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing its users with an aggregated view of AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS. The CloudWatch can also be used to detect anomalous behavior in the environments, visualize logs and metrics side by side, and troubleshoot issues.

aws lambda
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-aws-lambda/

AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that automatically runs code in response to events, without requiring you to manage the underlying infrastructure. It supports event-driven applications triggered by events such as HTTP requests.

What are Lambdas Functions?
AWS lambda are server-less compute functions which are fully managed by the AWS where developers can run there code without worrying about servers.AWS lambda functions will allow you to run the code without provisioning or managing servers.

Once you upload the source code file into AWS lambda in the form of ZIP file then AWS lambda will automatically run the code, without you provision the servers. AWS lambda are mostly used for the event-driven application for the data processing like Amazon S3 buckets, or responding to HTTP requests.

Example:
Process data from Amazon S3 buckets.
Respond to HTTP requests.
Build serverless applications.

Use Cases of AWS Lambda Functions
You can trigger the lambda in so many ways some of which are mentioned below.
File Processing: AWS lambda can be triggered by using simple storage services (S3). Whenever files are added to the S3 service Lambda data processing will be triggered.

---------------------------------------------------
Advantages of AWS Lambda Function
The following are the advantages of AWS Lambda function

Zero Server Management: Since AWS Lambda automatically runs the user’s code, there’s no need for the user to manage the server. Simply write the code and upload it to Lambda.

Event-Driven Architecture: AWS Lambda function can be triggered based on the events happing in the aws other service like when the file or video is added to the S3 bucket you can trigger the AWS Lambda function.

Affordable: With AWS Lambda, one doesn’t pay anything when the code isn’t running.

aws serverless lambda
https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda

Getting started with AWS Lambda
In this section we cover the steps needed to create, deploy and secure AWS Lambda functions. We cover two approaches:

Creating AWS Lambda functions using the AWS console

Creating AWS Lambda functions using the Serverless Framework
With the Serverless Framework, you can create Lambda functions using the tools you’re familiar with on your local machine and deploy to AWS in seconds. With this approach, your function’s code and configuration are located in the same Git repository which makes collaboration, change tracking and deployment of Lambda functions easier.

lambda api
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72580220/can-aws-lambda-act-as-an-api
Can AWS Lambda act as an API?
AWS Lambda can be used to serve an API. You could use API Gateway for setting up the API, and the serving can be done via a Lambda. It is a nice pattern.


limitations of lambda function
AWS Lambda functions have several limitations, including a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, a 6MB payload limit.
