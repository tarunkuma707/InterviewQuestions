http://snags88.github.io/singleton-pattern-in-laravel

The singleton pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, which can be useful when only one object is required across the system. â€¦ The first call will instantiate the object while any subsequent will only return the instantiated object.

csrf token (cross-site request forgery)
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/csrf
Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session managed by the application. This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the person actually making the requests to the application. Since this token is stored in the user's session and changes each time the session is regenerated, a malicious application is unable to access it.
